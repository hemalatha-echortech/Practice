            <p class="left">Quickly, word spread around town, and a few co-workers asked us if <br> we could share this “secret” collection of converting headlines with <br> them. We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw some very <br> positive results with these headlines as well.<br>
            They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could <br> make. This success inspired us to share our collection of 200 <br> headlines with everyone.</p>
